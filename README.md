Reusable github workflows

# Motivation

Instead of copy and pasting across two other repos after experimenting on a playground, making changes and verifying in one place will be a lot easier with low overhead.

## Things to know

- Consider minimizing impact by verifying on non-prod repos (i.e. playgrounds) and verifying new changes from a feature branch.
- When a breaking change is necessary, consider having release branches to maintain and go through repos and reference appropriately. At this time, keeping simple as the impact and ownership is minimal.
